1.5.0 (TBD)
===========
- FIFI-LS User Manual Iss. 04:

  - Document changes to spectral/spatial resolution data file,
    and clarify functionality of resample.
  - Enhanced telluric correction to automatically retrieve SDC-ATRAN
    transmission spectra and ECMWF water vapor data from the DaRUS Data Repository.
  - The pipeline now supports SDC-ATRAN and ECMWF binary table data formats.

- FORCAST pipeline v2.7.3:

  - Maintain compatibility with Photutils 3.0 in the FORCAST peak finding code,
    specifically the
    `rename of column names <https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whats_new/3.0.html#deprecated-table-column-names>`__.
    This is a breaking change, thus the minimum required version of Photutils
    has been updated to 3.0.

- EXES pipeline v3.1.0:

  - Download and cache bad pixel masks and dark files from DaRUS if not
    provided locally. Some of these files have been hosted in the Git
    repository but were not included in the published PyPI packages. While the
    README files directed the user to download directly from Github, the
    pipeline had functionality to download missing files from IRSA. However,
    the
    `IRSA Dataset <https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SOFIA/PIPELINE_REFERENCE/EXES/>`__
    is not complete. The new
    `SOFIA Redux EXES pipeline reference files <https://doi.org/10.18419/DARUS-5981>`__
    dataset at DaRUS contains the misssing files, so we removed them from the
    code repository.

- FLITECAM pipeline v2.1.0:

  - Download and cache calibration files from DaRUS instead of IRSA.

- General Upkeep

  - Work on the automatic documentation generation and deployment for the
    documentation site.
  - As a consequence of the Photutils 3.0 bump, minimum versions of other
    libraries also have been updated, including Astropy 6.1.4 and NumPy 2.1

1.4.3 (2026-03-25)
==================

- Fix compatibility with NumPy 2.4

  - Numba 0.64 has been released and unlocked NumPy 2.4 for us, revealing some
    issues with the handling of scalars and 0-dimensional arrays.

- New home for the Redux documentation: https://redux.sofiadatacenter.de

  - The documentation has been migrated to a new server hosted by the SOFIA Data Center.
  - The new documentation uses the
    `PyData Sphinx Theme <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__
    following most of the Scientific Python stack projects.
  - A version selector dropdown now lets you easily switch between documentation
    for different versions of the software.

- FIFI-LS User Manual Iss. 03:

  - Add a description for the Narrow Line Mode (NLM) and redshift
    and rest wavelength override parameters to the documentation.
