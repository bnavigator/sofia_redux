Grouping LEVEL\_1 data for processing
=====================================

FIFI-LS observations of a single object may dither in wavelength and/or
in space. It is common to use a set of FIFI-LS observations to map out
large regions of diffuse emission in a few small wavelength regions, but
it is also common to use FIFI-LS to take a set of observations of a
compact source over a wide range of wavelengths. As such, observations
cannot simply be split on the central wavelength, or the base positions
of the observation. Grouping relies on a keyword, ``FILEGPID``, which
defines a set of observations that should be reduced together to produce
one final spectral map. In addition, however, observations must always
be separated by detector channel, dichroic setting, nodding style
(symmetric vs. asymmetric), observation type (source vs. sky flat), and
the observational program ID. It may also be desirable to group file by
the observation ID (``AOR-ID``), but this is considered optional. This is
due to the fact that, because FIFI-LS incorporates a dichroic, different
AORs can have the same grating setting for one of the two detectors. In
such cases, the data sets with the same settings should be combined even
though the AORs are different. All of these requirements together define
a set of FITS keywords that must match in order for a group of input
files to be reduced together (see :numref:`fifi_grouping`).

Configuration and execution
===========================

.. _fifi_subsection_installation:

Installation
------------

The FIFI-LS pipeline is written entirely in Python.  The pipeline is
platform independent, but has been tested only on Linux and Mac OS X
operating systems.  Running the pipeline requires a minimum of 16GB RAM,
or equivalent-sized swap file.

The pipeline is primarily comprised of four modules within the `sofia_redux`
package: `sofia_redux.instruments.fifi_ls`, `sofia_redux.pipeline`,
`sofia_redux.spectroscopy`, and `sofia_redux.toolkit`. Additional optional
features are provided by the `sofia_redux.calibration` and `sofia_redux.scan`
modules.

The `fifi_ls` module provides the data processing
algorithms, with supporting libraries from the `toolkit` and `spectroscopy`
modules.  The `pipeline` module provides interactive and batch interfaces
to the pipeline algorithms.  The `calibration` module is used to provide
interactive photometry routines in the interactive interface.  The `scan`
module provides support for additional processing tasks specific to on-the-fly
mapping modes.

.. |inst| replace:: FIFI-LS
.. include:: ../../external-reqs-src-install.rst

.. _fifi_subsection_configuration:

Configuration
-------------

For FIFI-LS algorithms, default parameter values are defined by the
Redux object that interfaces to them. These values may be overridden
manually for each step, while running in interactive mode. They may also
be overridden by an input parameter file, in INI format, in either
interactive or automatic mode. See :ref:`fifi_appendix_sample_config_file`
for an example of an input parameter config file, which contains the current
defaults for all parameters.

Requirements for input header keywords are also specified in a
header definition file, called *headerdef.dat*, located in the
*sofia_redux/instruments/fifi_ls/data/header\_info/*
package directory. This table lists the keyword name, whether it is a
value required to be present in the input headers, its default value,
the data type of the value, and any requirements on the value range
(minimum value, maximum value, or enumerated value). The table also
defines how keywords from multiple input files should be combined for a
single output file (e.g. take the first value, take the sum,
string-concatenate, etc.). A sample of this header definition file is
given in :ref:`fifi_appendix_sample_headerdef_file`. All keywords present
in the table will be written to output files produced by the FIFI-LS Redux pipeline.

.. _fifi_subsection_input_data:

Input data
----------

Redux takes as input raw FIFI-LS FITS data files, which contain unsigned
tables. The number of frames per raw data cube depends on the readout
mode used to acquire the data. The FITS headers contain data acquisition
and observation parameters and, combined with the parameter config
files, comprise the information necessary to complete all steps of the
data reduction process. Some critical keywords are required to be
present in the raw data in order to perform a robust reduction (see :ref:`fifi_appendix_sample_headerdef_file`).
Raw data of older heritage may lack these keywords, and therefore it is recommended
to use only data taken from the latest IRSA archive. In the future this will
be superceded by the SDC's Virtual Observatory-based archive.

It is assumed that, prior to reduction, the input data have been correctly
grouped according to the criteria outlined in the section :ref:`fifi_grouping` above.
Redux considers all input files in a reduction to be science files that are
part of a single homogeneous reduction group, to be reduced together with the
same parameters. Some guards are in place to ensure the intercompatability of
input files, but this does not cover all possible permutations.

.. _fifi_subsubsection_auxiliary_files:

Auxiliary Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to complete a standard reduction, the pipeline requires a number
of auxiliary files. Most of these are included within the software package
provided via PyPI, stored in the *sofia_redux/instruments/fifi_ls/data* directory. 
Others, namely the SDC-ATRAN models and ECMWF water vapor data, are stored on the
DaRUS data repository, and are automatically accessed by the pipeline as needed.
Most auxiliary files can be overridden by the user with local files as needed,
with the use of input parameters for the relevant pipeline steps. See
:numref:`fifi_auxfiles` for a table of all commonly used types of auxiliary
FIFI-LS files.

FIFI-LS Reduction
-----------------

FIFI-LS data reduction with Redux follows the data reduction flowchart
given in :numref:`fifi_flowchart`. At each step, Redux attempts to determine
automatically the correct action, given the input data and default
parameters, but each step can be customized as needed.

Some key parameters to note are listed below.

-  **Check Headers**

   -  *Abort reduction for invalid headers*: By default, Redux will halt the
      reduction if the input header keywords do not meet requirements.
      Uncheck this box to attempt the reduction anyway.

-  **Fit Ramps**

   -  *Signal-to-noise threshold*: This value defines the
      signal-to-noise cut-off to flag a ramp as bad and ignore it. Set
      to -1 to skip the signal-to-noise cut.

   -  *Combination threshold (sigma)*: This value defines the
      rejection threshold for the robust mean combination of the ramp
      slopes. Set higher to reject fewer ramps, lower to reject more.

   -  *Bad pixel file*: By default, the pipeline looks
      up a bad pixel mask in *sofia_redux/instruments/fifi_ls/data/badpix\_files*. To override
      the default mask, use this parameter to select a different text
      file. The file must be an ASCII table with two columns: the spaxel
      number (1-25, numbered left to right in displayed array), and the
      spexel number (1-16, numbered bottom to top in displayed array).
      This option may be used to block a bad spaxel for a particular
      observation, by entering a bad pixel for every spexel index in a
      particular spaxel.

   -  *Remove 1st 2 ramps*: Select to remove the first two ramps. This is
      on by default.  This option has no effect if there
      are fewer than three ramps per chop.

   - *Subtract bias*: If set, the value from the open zeroth
     spexel will be subtracted before fitting.

   - *Threshold for grating instability*: Threshold in sigma for
     allowed ramp-averaged deviation from the expected grating position.
     Set to -1 to turn off filtering.

   - *Pointing discard*: If set, ramps during a chop cycle with bad pointing
     are discarded.

   - *Pointing directory*: Path to the directory containing the pointing error
     files used if pointing discard is set.

   - *Pointing threshold*: The pointing threshold is specified as a fraction
     of the FWHM of the PSF. The slopes of ramps with a pointing error greater
     than the defined threshold are set to NaN.

-  **Combine Nods**

   -  *Method for combining off-beam images*: For C2NC2 only: 'nearest'
      takes the closest B nod in time, 'average' will mean-combine before
      and after B nods, and 'interpolate' will linearly interpolate before
      and after B nods to the A nod time.  For OTF mode data, the B nods
      are interpolated to the time of each scan position.

   -  *Propagate off-beam image instead of on-beam*: If selected, B beams
      will be treated as if they were A beams for all subsequent
      reductions. That is, the map will be produced at the B position
      instead of the A. All other filenames and header settings will
      remain the same, so use with caution.  This option is mostly
      used for testing purposes.

   -  *Scale flux with backgrounds*: If set, the B nod fluxes are scaled by the ratio between
      A- and B nod backgrounds, prior to being subtracted from the A nod fluxes (OTF and TP modes only).

   -  *Perform telluric scaling*: If set, the telluric profiles of B nods are scaled to match the
      atmospheric properties at the zenith angle of their corresponding A nods (OTF and TP modes only).

-  **Spatial Calibrate**

   -  *Rotate by detector angle*: By default, Redux rotates the data by
      the detector angle to set North up and East to the left in the
      final map. Deselect this box to keep the final map in detector
      coordinates.

   -  *Flip RA/Dec sign convention (+, -, or default)*: For most data, the
      sign convention of the ``DLAM_MAP`` and ``DBET_MAP`` header keywords,
      which define the dither offsets, is determined automatically
      (parameter value "default"). Occasionally, for particular
      observations, these keywords may need their signs flipped,
      or used as is (no flip). This is usually determined by inspection of
      the results of the Resample step.

-  **Apply Flat**

   -  *Skip flat correction*: Select this option to skip flat-fielding the
      data. This option is mostly used for testing purposes.

   -  *Skip flat error propagation*: Deselect this option to propagate
      the systematic flat correction error in the flux error plane. This
      option is not currently recommended: the systematic error is instead
      measured from the error in the flux response, and stored in the ``CAL_ERROR`` extension.

-  **Combine Scans**

   -  *Correct bias offset*: Select this option to subtract an
      overall bias offset between the individual grating scans.

-  **Telluric Correct**

   -  *Skip telluric correction*: Select to skip correcting the data for
      telluric absorption. This option is mostly used for testing.

   -  *ATRAN directory*: Specify the location of ATRAN transmission files.
      If left blank, the pipeline will attempt to source ATRAN files from
      the DaRUS data repository.

   -  *Cutoff value*: Modify to adjust the transmission
      fraction below which the telluric-corrected data will be set to NaN.

   -  *Use ECMWF WV values*: Select to source water vapor values directly from
      ECMWF satellite data, which will be subsequently scaled to FIFI-LS values.
      This requires an ECMWF directory to be specified. If unticked, the
      pipeline will source water vapor values from pre-computed scaled values
      in the FIFI-LS headers (keyword ``WVZ_OBS``).

   -  *ECMWF Directory*: Specify the location of the ECMWF satellite data.
      Requires the *Use ECMWF WV values* option to be ticked.
      If left blank, the pipeline will attempt to source ECMWF data from
      the DaRUS data repository.

   -  *Narrow Line Mode (NLM)*: Select to use Narrow Line Mode for telluric correction.
      A single transmission value will be used for the complete wavelength
      range of the input data, determined from the redshift-corrected wavelength of the
      observed spectral line, using header keywords ``RESTWAV`` and ``REDSHIFT``.

   -  *(NLM) Z and Rest Wavelength Override*: Select to override automatic identification
      of the redshift and rest wavelength for the NLM telluric correction. Values for these
      can be manually specified in the subsequent two fields.

-  **Flux Calibrate**

   -  *Skip flux calibration*: Select to skip flux calibration of the
      data. The flux will remain in instrumental units (ADU/sec), with
      ``PROCSTAT=LEVEL_2``.  This option is mostly used for testing.

   -  *Response file*: Use this option to select a FITS
      file containing an instrumental response spectrum to use in place
      of the default file on disk.

-  **Correct Wave Shift**

   -  *Skip wavelength shift correction*: Select to skip applying the
      correction to the wavelength calibration due to barycentric
      velocity. In this case, both telluric-corrected and uncorrected
      cubes will be resampled onto the original wavelengths.
      This option is mostly used for testing.

-  **Resample**

   - General parameters

      -  *Use parallel processing*: If not set, data will be processed
         serially.  This will likely result in longer processing times,
         but smaller memory footprint during processing.

      -  *Maximum cores to use*: Specify the maximum cores to use, in the
         case of parallel processing.  If not specified, the maximum is
         the number of available cores, minus 1.

      -  *Check memory use during resampling*: If set, memory availability
         will be checked before processing, and the number of processes will
         be modified if necessary.  If not set, processing is attempted with
         the maximum number of cores specified.  Use with caution: in some
         conditions, unsetting this option may result in software or computer
         crashes.

      -  *Skip coadd*: If selected, a separate flux cube will be made from
         each input file, using the interpolation algorithm.
         This option is useful for identifying bad input files.

      -  *Interpolate instead of fit*: If set, an alternate resampling
         algorithm will be used, rather than the local polynomial surface
         fits. This option may be preferable for data with small dither
         offsets; it is not recommended for large maps.

      -  *Weight by errors*: If set, local fits will be weighted by the
         flux errors, as calculated by the pipeline.

      -  *Fit rejection threshold (sigma)*: If the fit value is more than this
         number times the standard deviation away from the weighted mean,
         the weighted mean is used instead of the fit value. This parameter
         is used to reject bad fit values.  Set to -1 to turn off.

      -  *Positive outlier threshold (sigma)*: Sets the rejection threshold for the
         input data, in sigma.  Set to -1 to turn off.

      -  *Negative outlier threshold (sigma)*: If non-zero, sets a separate
         rejection threshold in sigma for negative fluxes, to be used in a
         first-pass rejection.  Set to -1 to turn off.

      -  *Append distance weights to output file*: If set, distance weights
         calculated by the resampling algorithm will be appended to the output
         FITS file. This option is primarily used for testing.

      -  *Skip computing the uncorrected flux cube*: If set, the uncorrected
         flux data will be ignored.  This option is primarily for faster
         testing and/or quicklook, when the full data product is not required.

   - Scan resampling parameters

      -  *Use scan reduction before resample*: If set, an iterative scan
         reduction will be performed to attempt to remove residual correlated
         gain and noise before resampling.

      -  *Save intermediate scan product*: If set, the scan product will be
         saved to disk as a FITS file, for diagnostic purposes.

      -  *Scan options*: Parameters to pass to the scan reduction.
         Enter as key=value pairs, space-separated.

   - Spatial resampling parameters

      -  *Create map in detector coordinates*: If set, data are combined in
         arsecond offsets from the base position, rather than in sky coordinates.
         If not set, detector coordinates are used for nonsidereal targets and
         sky coordinates otherwise.

      -  *Spatial oversample*: This parameter controls the resolution of the output
         spatial grid, with reference to the fixed fit window FWHM for the given channel.
         The value is given in terms of pixels per reference FWHM for the
         detector channel used (5.0 arcsec for BLUE, 10.0 arcsec for RED).

      -  *Output spatial pixel size (arcsec)*: This parameter directly controls
         the resolution of the output spatial grid. If set, this
         parameter overrides the spatial oversample parameter. For BLUE data,
         the default value is 1.5 arcsec; for RED data, it is 3.0 arcsec.

      -  *Spatial surface fit order*: This parameter controls the
         order of the surface fit to the spatial data at each grid point. Higher
         orders give more fine-scale detail, but are more likely to be
         unstable. Set to zero to do a weighted mean of the nearby data.

      -  *Spatial fit window*: This parameter controls how much data to use in the
         fit at each grid point. It is given in terms of a factor times the
         fixed fit window FWHM for the given channel. Higher values will lead to more input data being
         considered in the output solution, at the cost of longer processing time.
         Too-low values may result in missing data (holes) in the output map.

      -  *Spatial smoothing radius*: Set to the fraction
         of the fit window to use as the radius of the distance-weighting
         Gaussian. Lowering this value results in finer detail for the same
         input fit window. Too low values may result in noisy output data;
         too high values effectively negate the distance weights.

      -  *Spatial edge threshold*: Specifies the threshold for setting edge
         pixels to NaN.  Set lower to block fewer pixels.

      -  *Adaptive smoothing algorithm*: If 'scaled', the size of the smoothing
         kernel is allowed to vary, in order to optimize reconstruction of
         sharply peaked sources. If 'shaped', the kernel shape and rotation
         may also vary. If 'none', the kernel will not vary.

   - Spectral resampling parameters

      -  *Spectral oversample*: This parameter controls the resolution of the output
         spectral grid. The value is given in terms of pixels per reference
         spectral FWHM at the central wavelength of the observation.

      -  *Output spectral pixel size (um)*: This parameter directly controls
         the resolution of the output spectral grid.  If set, this
         parameter overrides the spatial oversample parameter.  It does not
         have a default value.

      -  *Spectral surface fit order*: This parameter controls the
         order of the surface fit to the spectral data at each grid point.

      -  *Spectral fit window*: This parameter controls how much data to use in the
         fit at each wavelength grid point. It is given in terms of a factor times the
         average spatial FWHM. Higher values will lead to more input data being
         considered in the output solution, at the cost of longer processing time.
         Too-low values may result in missing data (holes) in the output map.

      -  *Spectral smoothing radius*: Set to the fraction
         of the fit window to use as the radius of the distance-weighting
         Gaussian, in the wavelength dimension.

      -  *Spectral edge threshold*: Specifies the threshold for setting edge
         pixels to NaN, in the wavelength dimension.  Set lower to block
         fewer pixels.

   -  *Skip making the preview image*: If set, no preview image (PNG file)
      will be produced.

   -  *Extension to map*: Extension name to display in the output image.
      This is typically ``FLUX`` in the first extension, but for some
      cubes, ``UNCORRECTED_FLUX`` may be more appropriate.

   -  *Method for selecting spectral slice*: May be 'reference' or 'peak'.
      If set to 'reference', the ``G_WAVE_B`` or ``G_WAVE_R`` keys are used
      to identify the reference wavelength.  The nearest wavelength slice
      to the reference wavelength will be used as the spectral slice for the

      is smoothed by a couple pixels, then the highest S/N voxel is used to
      select the spectral slice for the image.

   -  *Method for selecting spatial point*: May be 'reference' or 'peak'.
      If set to 'reference', the ``OBSRA`` and ``OBSDEC`` keys are used
      to identify the spatial point for the displayed spectrum.  For the
      'peak' method, the peak flux in the selected spectral slice is used to
      select the spatial point.

   -  *Override wavelength slice*: Manually specify the
      wavelength slice (zero-indexed) for the image.

   -  *Override spatial point*: Manually specify the
      spatial index for the spectrum, as 'x,y', zero-indexed.

   -  *Fraction of outer wavelengths to ignore*: Used with method = 'peak'.
      Set to 0 to include all wavelengths in calculating signal peak.  Set
      to a fraction less than 1 to exclude wavelengths at the beginning and

      color name may be specified.

   -  *Filled contours*: If set, contours will be filled instead of overlaid.

   -  *Overlay grid*: If set, a coordinate grid will be overlaid.

   -  *Beam marker*: If set, a beam marker will be added to the plot.

   -  *Overplot transmission*: If set, the atmospheric transmission spectrum
      will be displayed in the spectral plot.

   -  *Flux scale for spectral plot*: Specify a low and high percentile value
      for the spectral flux scale, e.g. [0,99].  If set to [0, 100],
      Matplotlib defaults are used.

.. _fifi_section_data_quality_assessment:

Data quality assessment
=======================

After the pipeline has been run on a set of input data, the output
products should be checked to ensure that the data has been properly
reduced.  Data quality and quirks can vary widely across individual
observations, but the following general guideline gives some strategies
for approaching quality assessment for FIFI-LS data.

-  Check the output to the log file (usually called
   *redux\_[date]\_[time].log*), written to the same directory as the
   output files. Look for messages marked ERROR or WARNING. The log will
   also list every parameter used in the pipeline steps, which may help
   disambiguate the parameters as actually-run for the pipeline.

-  Check that the expected files were written to disk: there should, at
   a minimum, be a scan-combined file (*SCM*), a flux-calibrated file
   (*CAL*), and a resampled file (*WXY*).

-  Look at each plane of the reduced image in the *WXY* file. Check that
   the resampling seems to have completed successfully: there
   should not be excessive holes in the map, or bad pixels away from the
   edges of the image. If there are, the spatial resampling may need to
   be redone with modified parameters.

-  Look at the spectra for a sampling of spatial pixels in the *WXY*
   file. Check that there are no sudden dropouts or other
   discontinuities in the spectrum that are not associated with poor
   atmospheric transmission. If there are such discontinuities, the
   wavelength resampling may need to be redone with modified parameters.

.. _fifi_appendix_sample_config_file:

Appendix A: Sample parameter config file
========================================

The below is a sample FIFI-LS Redux parameter config file in INI format.
If a value for any parameter is present, it will override the
corresponding default defined by the FIFI-LS reduction object. If not present, the
default value will be used - the sole exception is ``xy_pixel_size``, which is
computed at runtime based on the detector channel of the input data. The parameters
displayed here are the current default values.

Appendix C: Flux Calibration History
====================================

As described in the section :ref:`fifi_subsection_reduction_algorithms`, the flux calibration
response curves are generated from comparisons of FIFI-LS Mars Observations
with a time-resolved Mars flux model. Over the years, this procedure has been
refined and reprocessed using newer pipeline versions, resulting in a number
of different versions of the response curves. Here, the three major iterations
of flux calibration generation are described.

"USRA" Response Curves
----------------------
Fadda *et al*. 2023 [#Fadda2023]_ describes in detail the first major update to
the flux calibration procedure since the release of Redux (details of prior calibrations
are spurious and will not be documented here). This update was developed and implemented
at the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) in 2023, and was used for FIFI-LS
Redux versions 2.0.0 through 2.9.0.

This approach used mostly Mars as a calibrator, supplemented in the blue channel by a small
number of Callisto and Uranus measurements. The full dataset spanned 77 different flight-channel
configurations, from October 2015 to August 2022, and thus a considerable range of atmospheric
conditions and calibrator separations. The datasets were reduced to WXY products, using mostly standard 
Redux parameters. From the resulting data cube(s), a wavelength-dependent flux
was computed from a summation of the flux in all spaxels within each wavelength slice, excluding
the partially illuminated spaxel stack. These fluxes were then compared to the modelled
calibrator fluxes, including the model of Lellouch & Amri for Mars [#fn_fifi_mars2]_, and the
ESA2 models for Uranus and Callisto [#fn_fifi_uranus]_, [#fn_fifi_callisto]_. Resulting
plots of response datapoints and curves are shown in :numref:`fifi_response_fadda`.

There exist three noteworthy aspects to this approach. First, as outlined in Table 13 of the
FIFI-LS Handbook for Archive Users [#fn_fifi_archiveman]_, the telluric correction performed
on the reduced Mars data include flight-wise scaling factors used to convert derived ECMWF
water vapor values to FIFI-LS values. Such factors, and the flightwise variation between them,
introduce significant systematic variation and potential errors into the derived flux response,
and can be circumvented with the use of the new on-the-fly ECMWF-based telluric correction
developed at the SDC.

Second, as outlined in Tables 5 & 6 of the Archive Handbook, additional flightwise factors
were introduced to scale the flightwise response curves to a common median. As displayed in
:numref:`fifi_fadda_fluxcal_factors`, this scaling is quite successful in minimising the
significant flightwise scatter in the derived response datapoints. However, similar to the
telluric correction factors, these factors introduce further systematic variation to the
flux calibration process.

Third, the data reduction process utilises the standard Redux resample algorithm, which includes
a 3-dimensional interpolation onto an even spatial-spectral grid. Spatial interpolation of the
highly undersampled Mars disk may introduce significant errors in the derived fluxes when resampling
onto the output grid, particularly at low Mars separations, where a significant fraction of the Mars
flux may fall outside of the FIFI-LS FOV. While unlikely to be the cause of the significant scatter
seen in the response datapoints, this systematic effect may nevertheless be circumvented with the use
of a Drizzle-based resampling algorithm, which preserves the total flux between the input and
output grids.

   factors, to a median response curve, displayed in black. Bottom panel displays residual in

"DSI" Response Curves
---------------------
From v2.10.0 onwards, the pipeline used response curves generated at the
Deutsches SOFIA Institut (DSI) in 2024. This method utilises only Mars datasets,
reducing them similarly to the USRA method. Then, for each wavelength slice, it identifies the centre of
Mars via the brightest pixel, and sums all flux within a static aperture around that pixel. This approach
better captures the true measured flux, albeit without correcting for flux lost outside of the
FIFI-LS field of view. Additionally, flightwise atmospheric calibration factors
that were applied to the prior calibration have been removed in post-filter change
response curves. The pre-filter change response curves remain the same as before,
except those for the B2 filters, which have been scaled from their post-filter change
counterparts. This corrects for artefacts in the response curves, and also extends
response coverage for the [OIII] 52 micron line in the old filter configuration.
:numref:`fifi_fadda_dsi_response_comparison` displays the difference between the USRA
and DSI response versions for all FIFI-LS filter configurations.

"SDC" Response Curves
---------------------
Based on issues identified in both the USRA and DSI flux calibration approaches, an
updated flux calibration was developed at the SOFIA Data Center (SDC) in 2026.
This method utilises the aforementioned Drizzle-based resampling algorithm, along with
a fully time-resolved Mars model, and input Mars datasets reduced using newly developed
Redux features, such as the on-the-fly telluric correction and updated spectral resolution
tables.

During development, much effort was made to attempt to identify and mitigate
sources of scatter in the response datapoints, both between flights, and within individual
flights, without the use of flightwise scaling factors. As shown in :numref:`fifi_response_scatter`,
the scatter largely remains, however the resulting response curves indeed show some variation
from the previous two approaches. Nevertheless, thanks to the use of flux-preserving spatial-spectral
resampling and the updated Mars model, these SDC response curves are expected to be
more robust than prior versions. Remaining response scatter is propagated into the Redux
pipeline in the form of a wavelength-varying systematic error (extension ``CAL_ERROR``), stored separately to the existing
statistical error. Prior versions stored a far more generic systematic error as a
single value in the ``CALERR`` header keyword.

   :name: fifi_response_scatter

   SDC-derived response datapoints for RD105 new filter configuration, with fitted response curve.
   Considerable scatter remains in the datapoints both between flights and within individual flights.

Response values for the B2 D130 old filter configuration below 56.5 µm are scaled from the previously
used DSI response curve, which itself was scaled from their post-filter change counterparts, due to 
the lack of calibration data in this region as described in the "DSI" response curve section. The
response errors in this region are linearly extrapolated from the existing errors derived
from SDC-computed response datapoints. Therefore, calibration error maps covering wide wavelength
ranges within this region will exhibit a linear increase in error towards shorter wavelengths.

Order Filter Keywords
---------------------
As of FIFI-LS Redux v2.0.0., the pipeline accomodates an additional blue order keyword,
``G_FLT_B``, alongside the existing ``G_ORD_B`` keyword. For the vast majority of raw datasets
produced after this update, the two keywords are identical. The remaining datasets are all of
flux calibrators, and the additional keyword allows the pipeline to apply spectral flatfields
and response curves from one filter to the data taken with the other filter, necessary at
some specific wavelengths.
